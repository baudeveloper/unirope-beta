			<h4>Description</h4>
					<p>The first generation of lifting points with a double ball bearing for the direct connection of the VIP chain.</p>
					<p>Version PP-VIP.</p>
					<p>Connection only with RUD approved components, e.g., VC&Ouml;H-8, oval link, PP 2,5 t or the 8 mm VIP chain.</p>
					<p>Hint: the VIP chain connection is fool proof. When assembling the components, pay attention to the correct WLL allocation.</p>
					<p>Even under full load, can be turned in a 90&deg; position from the bolt centre line.</p>
					<p>Not suitable for permanent swiveling under full load.</p>
					<p>Choose the attachment points in such a way that the introduced forces are accommodated by the work piece without being deformed. Work piece material, at least 1.0037 (St 37).</p>
					<p>For light metals, non-ferrous heavy metals, and grey cast iron, the thread type allocation must be done in such a way that the WLL of the thread type fulfills the requirements of the respective work piece.</p>
					<p>Make sure the bolting surface is plain. Ensure an appropriate bore depth to facilitate an optimal sitting of the engaging surface.</p>
					<p>Maximum WLL with the smallest thread diameter. Thread length: 30 mm.</p>
					<p>For a single transportation procedure, bolting in and fastening tightly with a flat wrench is enough.</p>
					<p>Without a washer, the seat-engaging surface of the Power point (D) must completely lie onto the surface of the work piece. Is the Power point to be permanently loaded, it must be tightened with a torque of 70 nm.</p>
					<p>When impact loaded or operated in environments with skewing and vibrations, unintentional loosening can happen, especially if through bolts with nuts are used.</p>
				<p>Securing possibilities: Use of a liquid thread securing medium, e.g. Loctite (follow the manufacturer's recommendations), or positive bolt securing, for example, using a castellated nut with a split pin, a counter nut, etc.,</p></td>
