			    <!-- Product Description Here -->
			    <p>Pentagonal design. Clearly distinctive in comparison to the DIN 580 eye bolt.</p>
				  <p>Identification: clear WLL indication for the most unfavourable load direction F (not permissible for DIN 580).</p>
				  <p>With a forged ring body out of the material 1.4462, 100% electromagnetic crack detected and with a 4:1 design factor.</p>
				  <p>Ensure an appropriate bore depth to facilitate an optimal sitting of the engaging surface.</p>
				  <p>Without an additional washer, screw the INOX-STAR into the work piece until the seat-engaging surface of the hexagon socket bolt in the INOX-STAR evenly lies on the surface of the work piece.</p>
				  <p>The thread bore countersink is equal to the effective diameter of the thread.<br />
				    Always make sure that the hexagon socket bolt is tight before loading.</p>
				  <p>When impact loaded or operated in environments with skewing and vibrations, unintentional loosening can happen, especially if through bolts with nuts are used.</p>
				  <p>Securing possibilities: use of a liquid thread securing medium, e.g. Loctite (follow the manufacturer's recommendations).</p>
				  <p>In a tightened condition, the INOX-STAR must be able to swivel up to 360&deg;.</p>
				  <p>Before loading, adjust the assembly to the direction of the applied force.</p>
				  <p>A captive hexagon socket bolt, special bolt.</p>
				  <p>The INOX-STAR is patent protected: GM 9402014, and further industrial property rights are registered under GM 9316475.</p></td>
