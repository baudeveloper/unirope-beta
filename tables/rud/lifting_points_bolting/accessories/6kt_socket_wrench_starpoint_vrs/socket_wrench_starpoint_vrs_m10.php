	        <!-- Product Description Here -->
	        <p>The safety against the disengaging of the bolt connection of lifting points is mainly influenced by the torque of the bolt.</p>
		      <p>Lifting points, which permanently remain on the point of the force introduction, must be tightened according to the corresponding user manual.</p>
		      <p>For permanent use, the lifting points for bolting must be checked regularly for tightness.</p>
		      <p>The cranked socket wrench for the Starpoint-Vario-eye bolt enables an easy tightening with a suitable torque.</p>
		      <p># Observe the user manual for Starpoint VRS and socket wrench.<br />
	          # Socket wrench is nickel-plated, therefore also suitable for INOX-STAR.</p></td>
