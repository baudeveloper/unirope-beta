			    <p>The special relief lugs protect the securing bolt against bending and shearing loads. This provides additional safety.</p>
				  <p>Stowable with smaller bolts and thus low profile.</p>
				  <p>A favourable distribution of the introduced forces.</p>
				  <p>A forged ring according to EN 1677-1, quality grade 80, 100% electromagnetic crack detected and coloured red.</p>
				  <p>It is in compliance with the approval requirements of the respective employers' liability insurance association (BG).</p>

				  <p>Work piece material, at least 1.0037 (St 37).</p>
				  <p>For light metals, non-ferrous heavy metals, and grey cast iron, the thread type allocation must be done in such a way that the WLL of the thread type fulfills the requirements of the respective work piece.</p>
				  <p>Tighten up the bolts with a torque of 600 nm.</p>
				  <p>When impact loaded or operated in environments with vibrations, unintentional loosening can happen.</p>
				  <p>Securing possibilities: use of a liquid thread securing medium, e.g. Loctite (follow the manufacturer's recommendations), or positive bolt securing, for example, using a castellated nut with a split pin, a counter nut, etc.</p>
				  <p>After being used over a longer period of time, inspect the bolts to make sure they are still tight.</p></td>
