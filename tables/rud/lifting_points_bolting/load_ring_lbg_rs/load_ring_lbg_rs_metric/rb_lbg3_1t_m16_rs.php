			    <!-- Product Description Here -->
			    <p>Stainless lifting point with a special bolt.</p>
				  <p>The load ring pivots and additionally swivels in all directions.</p>
		    <p>Before loading, adjust the load ring to the direction of the applied force, ensure that it is freely movable and that it does not contact or lean onto the edges. Avoid swiveling while in loaded condition.</p>
				  <p>Only a single tapped bore is required.<br />
			      Extremely small design.</p>
				  <p>The threaded connector on to the work piece material must be suitable for force introduction.</p>
				  <p>The bolting surface (N) has to be plane. Ensure an appropriate bore depth to facilitate an optimal sitting of the engaging surface.</p>
				  <p>For a single transportation procedure, bolting in and fastening tightly with a flat wrench is enough.</p>
				  <p>Without a washer, the seat-engaging surface of the load ring must completely and evenly lie onto the surface of the work piece.</p>
				  <p>Is the load ring to be permanently loaded, it must be tightened with a torque of (&plusmn;10%) 100 nm.</p>
				  <p>In a tightened condition, the load ring must be able to swivel up to 360&deg;.</p>
				  <p>When impact loaded or operated in environments with skewing and vibrations, unintentional loosening can happen, especially if through bolts with nuts are used.</p>
				  <p>Securing possibilities: use of a liquid thread securing medium, e.g. Loctite (follow the manufacturer's recommendations).</p></td>
