			    <!-- Product Description Here -->
			    <p>With increased WLL in axial direction and when load ring is aligned.</p>
				  <p>For all loads, which have to be flipped and turned-over.</p>
				  <p>Loadable in any direction: safety factor 4.<br />
				    Can be turned under load.<br />
				    Cannot be turned continuously in 90&deg; direction at full load.</p>
				  <p>Can also be supplied with longer thread lengths.<br />
				    Simple assembly, just a tapped hole is required.<br />
				    High tensile, tested lifting lug acc. to EN1677-4.<br />
				    Surface: pink powder coated.</p>
				  <p>The bolting position has to be designed in such a way that the introduced forces are accommodated by the work piece without being deformed. Pay attention to a plane surface.</p>
				  <p>Blind holes have to be drilled deep enough to make sure that bolt-on flange has a proper support. Minimum steel quality 1.0037 (St 37).</p>
				  <p>When using light metals, non-ferrous heavy metals, and grey cast iron, the thread classification must be chosen in such a way that the WLL of the thread is according to the strength of the base material.</p>
				  <p>Due to the ball bearings, for a normal single lift, tightening with a wrench without an extension acc. to DIN 895 respectively DIN 894 is sufficient.</p>
				  <p>The VWBG must have full support on the bolt-on surface (D) without using a shim ring. If the VWBG stays permanent at the load, tensioning with a torque of 750 nm is required.</p>
				  <p>In case of shock loading, twisting or vibrating, especially with through hole bolt connections using nuts, an unintentional dismounting may occur.</p>
				  <p>Securing possibilities: a liquid locking glue, e.g. Loctite (read the instructions of the manufacturer), or a mechanical form locking bolt device, e.g. a crown nut with a cotter, should be used.</p></td>
