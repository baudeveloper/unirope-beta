			    <!-- Product Description Here -->
			    <p>Suitable for all loads which swivel and tilt.<br />
			    Can be loaded in all directions with a 4:1 design factor.</p>
				  <p>Swiveling under full load is permissible provided the inclination angle is not perpendicular to the screw-in direction. Not suitable for permanent swiveling under full load. Can also be supplied with variable (vario) thread lengths. Easy assembly due to the single threaded tapping.</p>
				  <p>High tensile, inspected suspension ring according to EN 1677-4. The surface is both red powder coated and zinc plated. Patent 4336779-VARIO.</p>
				  <p>Choose the attachment points in such a way that the introduced forces are accommodated by the work piece without being deformed. Make sure the bolting surface is plain. Ensure an appropriate bore depth to facilitate an optimal sitting of the engaging surface. Work piece material, at least 1.0037 (St 37).</p>
				  <p>For light metals, non-ferrous heavy metals, and grey cast iron, the thread type allocation must be done in such a way that the WLL of the thread type fulfills the requirements of the respective work piece.</p>
				  <p>Owing to the presence of the ball bearing, in case of a single transportation procedure, fastening with a flat wrench according to DIN 895 or DIN 894 without using an extension is enough.</p>
				  <p>Without a washer, the seat-engaging surface of the WBG-V (D) must completely and evenly lie onto the surface of the work piece. Is the WBG-V to be permanently loaded, it must be tightened with a torque of 150 nm.</p>
				  <p>When impact loaded or operated in environments with skewing and vibrations, unintentional loosening can happen, especially if through bolts with nuts are used.</p>
				  <p>Securing possibilities: use of a liquid thread securing medium, e.g. Loctite (follow the manufacturer's recommendations), or positive bolt securing, for example, using a castellated nut with a split pin, a counter nut, etc.</p>
				  <p>The WBG-V is not suitable for permanent swiveling under full load.</p></td>
