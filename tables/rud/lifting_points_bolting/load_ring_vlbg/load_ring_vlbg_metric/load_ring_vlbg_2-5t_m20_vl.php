				  <!-- Product Description Here -->
				  <p>Fully captive 100% crack detected hexagon head cap bolts with thread lengths of H= 20&ndash;187 mm available.</p>
					<p>When ordering implicitly indicate the required length.<br />
					  Including washers and crack detected nuts.</p>
					<p>Load ring is stowable and swivels in all directions. The load ring must be flexible and adjusted to the load direction before being loaded. Ensure that there is no contact between the ring and the edges of the work piece. Avoid swiveling under full load.</p>
					<p>A single threaded hole or a through hole is necessary. A very small construction. Choose the attachment points in such a way that the introduced forces are accommodated by the base material without being deformed.</p>
					<p>Work piece material, at least 1.0037 (St 37). The BG recommends the following min. thread lengths:<br />
					  1 x M for Steel<br />
					  1.25 x M for Cast<br />
					  2 x M for Aluminium</p>
					<p>For light metals, non-ferrous heavy metals, and grey cast iron, the thread type allocation must be done in such a way that the WLL of the thread type fulfills the requirements of the respective work piece.</p>
					<p>Make sure the bolting surface is plain. Ensure an appropriate bore depth to facilitate an optimal sitting of the engaging surface. For a single transportation procedure, bolting in and fastening tightly with a flat wrench is enough.</p>
					<p>Without a washer, the seat-engaging surface of the VLBG must completely lie onto the surface of the work piece (&Oslash;A). Is the VLBG to be permanently loaded, it must be tightened with a torque of (&plusmn;10%) 250 nm.</p>
					<p>In a tightened condition 360&deg; swiveling should be ensured.</p>
					<p>When impact loaded or operated in environments with skewing and vibrations, unintentional loosening can happen, especially if through bolts with nuts are used.</p>
					<p>Securing possibilities: use of a liquid thread securing medium, e.g. Loctite (follow the manufacturer's recommendations), or positive bolt securing, for example, using a castellated nut with a split pin, a counter nut, etc.</p></td>
