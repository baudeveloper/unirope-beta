			    <!-- Product Description Here -->
			    <p>With the following characteristics, distinctive in comparison to the conventional DIN-eye nuts.</p>
				  <p>An octagonal shape symbolizing quality class 8. Coloured red, the identification colour of quality class 8.</p>
				  <p>Identification: clear WLL indication for the most unfavourable load direction F2 (not permissible for DIN 581).</p>
				  <p>Forged material 1.6541, high tensile and annealed, 100% electromagnetic crack detected according to EN 1677-1 and with a 4:1 design factor.</p>
				  <p>Loaded in the direction F1, an up to four times higher factor of the value F2 is acceptable. </p>
				  <p>Always make sure that the eye bolt is tight before loading. Swiveling movements must be avoided during transportation. Not suitable for swiveling under load.</p>
				  <p>It does not automatically adjust to the direction of pull, hence not permitted in the mining industry.</p>
				  <p>For the RUD RM-eye nuts, the threaded connector component must be of at least quality grade 8.8. Without an additional washer, the seat-engaging surface (E) must evenly and completely lie onto the surface of the work piece. </p>
				  <p>When impact loaded or operated in environments with vibrations, unintentional loosening can happen.</p>
				  <p>Securing possibilities: use of a liquid thread securing medium, e.g. Loctite (follow the manufacturer's recommendations), or the positive bolt securing.</p></td>
