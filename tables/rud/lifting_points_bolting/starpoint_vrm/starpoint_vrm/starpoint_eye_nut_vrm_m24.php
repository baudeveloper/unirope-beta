			    <!-- Product Description Here -->
			    <p>Star shaped design.</p>
			    <p>A clear distinction from the DIN 582 eye nut.</p>
			    <p>Colour: a striking fluorescent pink powder coating.</p>
			    <p>Identification: clear WLL indication for the most unfavourable load direction F (not permissible for DIN 582).</p>
			    <p>Forged material 1.6541, high tensile and annealed, 100% electromagnetic crack detected according to EN 1677-1 and with a 4:1 design factor.</p>
			    <p>In a tightened condition, the VRS must swivel 360&deg;. Adjust the VRS to the direction of pull, before attaching the lifting means.</p>
			    <p>The WLL values are only valid in connection with quality class 10.9 threaded bolts. The threads of the nut must exactly engage the bolt threads.</p>
			    <p>The mounted thread pin must ensure a perfect fitting of the seat-engaging surface of the eye nut onto the work piece.</p>
			    <p>Eye nuts, whose nut inserts do not perfectly lie on to the work piece, should never be loaded. </p>
			    <p>Not suitable for swiveling under load.</p>
			    <p>When impact loaded or operated in environments with vibrations, unintentional loosening can happen.</p>
			    <p>Securing possibilities: use of a liquid thread securing medium, e.g. Loctite (follow the manufacturer's recommendations).</p>
