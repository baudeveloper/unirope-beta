			    <!-- Product Description Here -->
			    <p>With the following characteristics, distinctive in comparison to the conventional DIN-eye bolts.</p>
				  <p>An octagonal shape symbolizing quality class 8. Coloured red, the identification colour of quality class 8.</p>
				  <p>Identification: clear WLL indication for the most unfavourable load direction F2 (not permissible for DIN 580).</p>
				  <p>Forged material 1.6541, high tensile and annealed, 100% electromagnetic crack detected according to EN 1677-1 and with a 4:1 design factor.</p>
				  <p>Loaded in the direction F1, an up to four times higher factor of the value F2 is acceptable. Work piece material, at least 1.0037 (St 37).</p>
				  <p>For light metals, non-ferrous heavy metals, and grey cast iron, the thread type allocation must be done in such a way that the WLL of the thread type fulfills the requirements of the respective work piece. Make sure the bolting surface is plain. Ensure an appropriate bore depth to facilitate an optimal sitting of the engaging surface.</p>
				  <p>Always make sure that the eye bolt is tight before loading. The seat-engaging surface of the eye bolt must evenly and completely lie onto the surface of the work piece. Swiveling movements must be avoided during transportation.</p>
				  <p>When impact loaded or operated in environments with vibrations, unintentional loosening can happen.</p>
				  <p>Securing possibilities: use of a liquid thread securing medium, e.g. Loctite (follow the manufacturer's recommendations).</p>
				  <p>For applications of the RS eye bolt there is a reliable-operations certification by the respective technical Committee.</p>
				  <p>It does not automatically adjust to the direction of pull. Not according to the RAG-Standard (Germany).</p></td>
