			    <!-- Product Description Here -->
			    <p>The first generation of lifting points for welding with a universal connection for every slinging means (hook and ring assemblies, endless sling chains, round slings, loops, etc).</p>
			    <p>Provided with a double ball-bearing, which enables jerk-free tilting, swiveling and turning.</p>
			    <p>The optimized design avoids the damaging of both the slinging means and the precious load when swiveling.</p>
			    <p>Version WPP-S: the standard universal welding connection, using eye hooks for ring assemblies, round slings, wire ropes, hook assemblies, etc.</p>
			    <p>It is not suitable for permanent swiveling under full load.</p>
			    <p>Welding should be carried out only by a qualified person acc. to DIN EN 287-1.</p>
