			    <!-- Product Description Here -->
			    <p>An enhancement of the well established RBS series with an up to 30% increment of the WLL.</p>
			    <p>The two points of attachment facilitate an even and optimal force distribution into the work piece, thus usage of thinner base plates is possible.</p>
			    <p>A forged ring bracket (according to EN1677-1), electromagnetically crack detected, pink coated (heat indicator), and meeting the approval requirements of the respective safety authorities.</p>
			    <p>The ring is stowable, thus avoiding the hazard of tripping.</p>
			    <p>Low profile, high dynamic, and static strength.</p>
			    <p>The welding block is forged out of a good welding material 1.0577+N (St 52-3) and clearly stamped with an identification number for the permissible WLL.</p>
			    <p>The patented distance lugs are for the measurement and provision of the required gap for the root welding (approximately 3 mm).</p>
			    <p>Welding should only be carried out by qualified persons according to EN 287-1.</p>
