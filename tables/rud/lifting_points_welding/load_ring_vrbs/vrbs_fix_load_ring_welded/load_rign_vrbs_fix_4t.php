			    <!-- Product Description Here -->
			    <p>Weld-on parts without bothersome sub-surface corrosion due to circular HY-weld seam. </p>
			    <p>Smaller weld seam compared to the previous VRBS.</p>
			    <p>Total length and total width identical to the previous VRBS.<br /><br /><br />
		      </p>
			    <p>No time-consuming alignment between the weld-on blocks and ring. Clamp spring is protected being placed inside the weld-on block.</p>
			    <p>The spring fixes the weld-on blocks to the ring and creates, at the same time, a radial clamping.</p>
			    <p>No loose items.<br /><br /><br />
		      </p>
			    <p>Clamping spring avoids rattling noise.<br /><br /><br />
		      </p>
			    <p>Recognition of inclination angle indicated by markings on the ring and on the blocks in all levels.</p>
