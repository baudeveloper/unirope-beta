			    <!-- Product Description Here -->
			    <p>An enhancement of the well-established LBS with an up to 50% increment of the WLL!</p>
			    <p>The new VLBS ring bracket is forged out of the high strength material CrNiMo with 2 patented inner supporting lugs. It provides an optimal sitting of the hook and offers better protection for the clamping springs.</p>
			    <p>Given an inclined or a non-parallel welding surface, the support effect is extremely improved.</p>
			    <p>Pink powder coating: both a VIP identification characteristic and a heat indicator.</p>
			    <p>An easy and quick to weld assembly.<br />
			      High dynamic and static strength.</p>
			    <p>The pink coated ring bracket is manufactured and tested according to EN 1677-1 and meets the approval requirements of the respective safety authorities.</p>
			    <p>The welding block is forged out of a good welding material 1.0577+N (St 52-3) and clearly stamped with an identification number for the permissible WLL.</p>
			    <p>The distance lugs are for the measurement and provision of the required gap for the root welding (approx. 3 mm).</p>
			    <p>Important: the weld arrangement (continuous HV weld) fulfills the requirements of DIN 18800, i.e., the closed weld avoids corrosion and is thus suitable for outdoor use.</p>
			    <p>Welding should only be carried out by qualified persons according to EN 287-1.</p>
