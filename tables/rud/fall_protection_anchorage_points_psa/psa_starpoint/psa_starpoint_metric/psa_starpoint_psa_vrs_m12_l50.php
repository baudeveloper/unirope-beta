			    <!-- Product Description Here -->
			    <p>Lifting point to be used as an anchor point for personal protective equipment (acc. to DIN EN 795), certified by the German BG BAU ( Employer's insurance association of the building industry).</p>
			    <p>Star-shaped, distinctive variety to DIN 580 eye bolt.</p>
			    <p>Colour: remarkable yellow powder coating.</p>
			    <p>Marking: acc. to DIN EN 365 including statement for the number of load bearing persons (1 person).</p>
			    <p>The VRS-PSA is not supposed to be used permanently outdoor. For this application we recommend the PSA-INOX-Star.</p>
			    <p>Forged material 1.6541, high-tensile quenched and tempered, 100% electromagnetic crack inspected (according to En 1677-1).</p>
			    <p>Safety factor: 4</p>
			    <p>Bolt in material quality should be at least 1.0037 (ST37).</p>
			    <p>In light metal, non-ferrous heavy metal, grey cast iron, concrete, wood, and stone, the determination of the thread must be chosen in such a way that the thread working load complies with the base material (please observe the data of the plug manufacturer).</p>
			    <p>Blind holes must be drilled deep enough to make sure that the bearing surface sits properly.</p>
			    <p>Screw down the PSA-INOX-Star without any additional washer into the base material, until the bearing surface of the hexagon socket screw sits close to the bolt-on surface.</p>
			    <p>If the PSA-INOX-STAR is supposed to be fixed permanent at the load accepting point, please tighten the hexagon socket screw of the PSA with a torque of 25 nm.</p>
			    <p>Sinking of the threaded hole should have the diameter of the nominal thread.</p>
			    <p>During usage please control that the hexagon socket screw is tightened.</p>
			    <p>If shock load, turning or vibration occurs, especially in steel when through-hole fixing with nut is used, an unintentional loosening can happen.</p>
			    <p>Securing method: liquid thread locking, for example Loctite (please pay attention to the manufacturer's instruction).</p>
			    <p>PSA-INOX-STAR must be able to be turned by 360&deg; when screw is tightened.</p>
			    <p>Component is protected by Patent: GM9402014<br />
			      GM 9316475 additional patents are applied.</p>
			    <p>For installation without a tool the PSA-Starpoint can be ordered with a quenched and tempered star-profile Allen key.</p>
			    <p>Very simple: engage star profile Allen key into the hexagon (tightening and loosening by hand is possible), then unlatch.<br />
			      Done: PSA-VRS can be turned!</p>
