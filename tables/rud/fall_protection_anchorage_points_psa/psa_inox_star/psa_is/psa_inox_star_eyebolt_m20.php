		      <!-- Product Description Here -->
		      <p>Lifting point to be used as an anchor point for personal protective equipment (acc. to DIN EN 795), certified by the German BG BAU ( Employer's insurance association of the building industry).</p>
			    <p>Penta-shaped, distinctive variety to DIN 580 eye bolt.</p>
			    <p>Marking: acc. to DIN EN 365 including statement for the number of load bearing persons (2 persons).</p>
			    <p>Forged material 1.4462; 100% electromagnetic crack inspected, with a good resistance against removing and local corrosion, like pitting or selective corrosion, crevice corrosion, and stress crack corrosion in salt water and high-chloride, as well as in H2S containing medias.</p>
			    <p>The material must not be used in the following environment: indoor swimming pool atmosphere, especially at load bearing construction, without being constantly flushed by water or regularly cleaned. If that happens, the malfunction leads to personal injuries.</p>
			    <p>For example as a fixing of water slides or any other construction element (ISER-code of practice 831).</p>
			    <p>Safety factor: 4</p>
			    <p>Bolt in material quality should be at least 1.0037 (ST37).</p>
			    <p>In light metal, non-ferrous heavy metal, grey cast iron, concrete, wood, and stone, the determination of the thread must be chosen in such a way that the thread working load complies with the base material (please observe the data of the plug manufacturer).</p>
			    <p>Blind holes must be drilled deep enough to make sure that the bearing surface sits properly.</p>
			    <p>Screw down the PSA-INOX-Star without any additional washer into the base material, until the bearing surface of the hexagon socket screw sits close to the bolt-on surface.</p>
			    <p>If the PSA-INOX-STAR is supposed to be fixed permanent at the load accepting point, please tighten the hexagon socket screw of the PSA with a torque of 115 nm.</p>
			    <p>Sinking of the threaded hole should have the diameter of the nominal thread.</p>
			    <p>During usage please control that the hexagon socket screw is tightened.</p>
			    <p>If shock load, turning or vibration occurs, especially in steel when through-hole fixing with nut is used, an unintentional loosening can happen.</p>
			    <p>Securing method: liquid thread locking, for example Loctite (please pay attention to the manufacturer's instruction).</p>
			    <p>PSA-INOX-STAR must be able to be turned by 360&deg; when screw is tightened.</p>
			    <p>Captive hexagon socket screw.</p>
			    <p>Component is protected by Patent: GM9402014</p>
			    <p>GM 9316475 additional patents are applied.</p>
